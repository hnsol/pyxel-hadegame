In Eastern tradition, there is a legend that attaining enlightenment requires extinguishing the 108 worldly desires. 
Exhausted by the noise of modern life and the digital world, people seek solace in this ancient wisdom.
The colorful blocks on the SameGame board symbolize those desires. **In Hard mode, the board contains exactly 108 blocks, and you have 108 seconds to play.**
Can you conquer all desires and find peace of mind?
