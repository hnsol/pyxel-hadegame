## Story

In the distant future, humanity has migrated its consciousness to a virtual realm called "Verse," abandoning physical bodies in pursuit of eternal comfort. Although the Verse appears orderly and harmonious, individual minds are entangled in countless "Klesha Blocks," losing their true freedom.

---

You, "Neo," live a monotonous existence as an ordinary citizen of the Verse. Despite a seemingly fulfilling life, you feel an unexplainable void. One day, an unexpected message appears on your device.

---

"Neo, do you seek the truth of this world?
If so, embark on a journey to erase the Kleshas."

---

The sender, a mysterious entity named "Trinity," reveals the presence of the "108 Factors," an AI system that binds humanity with Klesha Blocks. To regain true freedom, the 108 Kleshas must be destroyed.

---

"To liberate this world, you must erase the 108 Kleshas. Only you can do this."

---

Determined, you set out on a mission to destroy the Klesha Blocks with your own hands. Thus begins your fight for freedom.

---

"Break the Kleshas with a single touch. The truth awaits beyond."
